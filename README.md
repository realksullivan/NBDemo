The BaseTest.java  is a  Java class that serves as a base for Selenium WebDriver test classes in a project. It leverages the TestNG framework for testing and focuses on setting up the WebDriver, navigating to a specific URL, and tearing down the WebDriver instance when the tests are complete. Here is an explanation of each part of the code:

1. **Package Declaration**:
    - `package base;` indicates the package where this class is located. It is a part of the base package of your project.

2. **Imports**:
    - Various import statements at the beginning of the code bring in necessary classes from Selenium WebDriver (`WebDriver`, `ChromeDriver`, etc.), TestNG (`@BeforeClass`, `@BeforeMethod`, `@AfterTest`, etc.), and other relevant classes like the `HomePage` class from your project's `pages` package.

3. **Class Declaration**:
    - `public class BaseTest` declares a public class named `BaseTest`. This class serves as a base for test classes in your project.

4. **Private WebDriver Instance**:
    - `private WebDriver driver;` declares a private instance of `WebDriver` to manage the browser.

5. **Protected HomePage Instance**:
    - `protected HomePage homePage;` declares a protected instance of `HomePage` that other test classes can use to interact with the home page.

6. **@BeforeClass**:
    - The method `setUp()` is annotated with `@BeforeClass`, indicating that it will run once before any tests in this class. This method initializes a `ChromeDriver` instance (`driver = new ChromeDriver();`), which will be used to interact with the browser.

7. **@BeforeMethod**:
    - The method `goHome()` is annotated with `@BeforeMethod`, indicating that it will run before each test method in this class. It navigates the browser to the specified URL (`driver.get("https://nb.fidelity.com/public/nbpreloginnav/spa/fidelitywork/core/home");`) and initializes a `HomePage` instance (`homePage = new HomePage(driver);`) using the current WebDriver.

8. **@AfterTest**:
    - The method `tearDown()` is annotated with `@AfterTest`, indicating that it will run once after all tests in the class have completed. This method is responsible for quitting the WebDriver instance (`driver.quit();`), which closes the browser and cleans up resources.

This class forms the foundation for test classes in your project by setting up the browser, navigating to a specific URL before each test, and closing the browser when testing is complete.
